# Welcome

This project was initially based on my example at [https://github.com/TheRobBrennan/explore-python](https://github.com/TheRobBrennan/explore-python). It will explore getting started developing with [Python](https://www.python.org) as quickly as possible using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com).

Special thanks to [Ander Fern√°ndez Jauregui](https://anderfernandez.com/en/blog/how-to-create-api-python/) for writing the [How to create an API in Python](https://anderfernandez.com/en/blog/how-to-create-api-python/) blog post that has inspired this repo.

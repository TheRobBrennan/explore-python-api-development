# Welcome

This project was initially based on my example at [https://github.com/TheRobBrennan/explore-python](https://github.com/TheRobBrennan/explore-python). It will explore getting started developing with [Python](https://www.python.org) as quickly as possible using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com).

Special thanks to [Ander FernÃ¡ndez Jauregui](https://anderfernandez.com/en/blog/how-to-create-api-python/) for writing the [How to create an API in Python](https://anderfernandez.com/en/blog/how-to-create-api-python/) blog post that has inspired this repo.

## Local development

### Install dependencies and run our project

```sh
# Verify that you have Python installed on your machine
% python3 --version

# Create a new virtual environment for the project
% python3 -m venv .venv

# Select your new environment by using the Python: Select Interpreter command in VS Code
#   - Enter the path: ./.venv/bin/python

# Activate your virtual environment
% source .venv/bin/activate
(.venv) %

# Install Python packages in a virtual environment
# EXAMPLE: Install simplejson - https://pypi.org/project/simplejson/
% pip install simplejson
# ... continue to install packages as needed ...

# When you are ready to generate a requirements.txt file
% pip freeze > requirements.txt

# What happens if you want to uninstall a package?

# Uninstall the package from your virtual environment
# % pip uninstall simplejson

# Remove the dependency from requirements.txt if it exists
# % pip uninstall -r requirements.txt

# Install the packages from requirements.txt
(.venv) % pip install -r requirements.txt
```

That's it! Now, if you re-run the program - with or without the debugger - your Python script should have executed.
